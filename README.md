## Usage

- ### Initialization: 
Create an instance of the rsAnimate() class by providing a text element as a parameter.
#### For Example :-
    const animation = new rsAnimate(path);


`path`: The text element on which the animation will be applied.
#### For Example:-
     const path =  document.querySelector("h2");

- ### Configuration: 
Customize the animation by passing an options object to the waveSplitInit function.

#### For Exmaple:- 
    animation.waveSplitInit({
        repeat:false,    // Boolean indicating whether the animation should repeat.
        inAni: "flipY",    // Name of the desired animation effect.
        baseColor: "white",    // Base color of the text.
        inColor:"blue",    // Color of the incoming animation. Works With `colorAdd`
        inDir:"left",    // Direction of the animation beginning (left, right).
        outDir:"right",    //Direction of the outgoing beginning (left, right).
        pauseTime:2000,    // Pause time between animations.
        speedControl:false,    // Control Printing Speed.
        aniSpeed:6000, // Speed of the animation.
        onView:false  // Animation Start When Element On Screen (viewport)
    });
