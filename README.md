## Usage

- ### Initialization: 
Create an instance of the rsAnimate() class by providing a text element as a parameter.
#### For Example :-
    const animation = new rsAnimate(path);


`path`: The text element on which the animation will be applied.
#### For Example:-
     const path =  document.querySelector("h2");

- ### Configuration: 
Customize the animation by passing an options object to the waveSplitInit function.

#### For Exmaple:- 
    animation.waveSplitInit({
        repeat: false,        // Boolean indicating whether the animation should repeat.
        inAni: "topFade",     // Name of the desired animation effect.
        baseColor: "rgb(18, 180, 23)", // Base color of the text.
        inColor: "white",     // Color of the incoming animation. Works With `colorAdd`
        inDir: "left",        // Direction of the animation beginning (left, right).
        outDir: "right",      //Direction of the outgoing beginning (left, right).
        pauseTime: 1,         // Pause time between animations.
        aniSpeed: 100         // Speed of the animation.
    });
